You can use any language to solve the problems and feature.

### Problems -

1. Consider a MS Excel worksheet. We have column 'A' as first column, 'B' as second, ... 'Z' as 26th, 'AA' as 27th, 'AB' as 28th ..etc. Given an integer, find what would be the corresponding column reference in Excel. Eg: If input is 10, return 'J'. If input is 27, return 'AA'.

2. If you were working on a React application that was rendering a page very slowly, how would you go about investigating and fixing the issue?

3. I want to refactor a legacy system. You want to rewrite it from scratch. Argument. Then, switch our roles.
